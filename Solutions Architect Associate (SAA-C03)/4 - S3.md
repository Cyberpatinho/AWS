<h2>4.1 - S3 Security (Resource Policies & ACLs)</h2><a name="4.1"></a>


- S3 is private by default, only the root account has initial access to it
- Resource Policies contrast to identity policies in the sense that they allow controlling access from outside the account (even from sources not authenticated by AWS, also known as **Anonymous Principals**)
- Example of resource policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Sid": "DenyObjectsThatAreNotSSEKMS",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*",
    }]
}
```

- The **Principal** component specifies to who the policy applies

- The effective access is the combination of all the applicable identity policies (including external ones from the accessing account) plus the resource policies

- **ACLs** are a limited legacy version of resources policies not recommended for use by AWS anymore

  

<h2>4.2 - S3 Static Hosting</h2><a name="4.2"></a>


- CLI and Console S3 access are done via **AWS APIs** with authentication and authorization

- Static Website Hosting allows standard **HTTP** access via a browser

- Useful for **offloading**, by storing static media from a dynamic webpage into S3 buckets, which is generally cheaper 

- Useful for **out-of-band pages**, such as a maintenance notification which shouldn't be hosted in the same server that is being worked on 

- S3 charges by amount of HTTP requests, but the fees are usually really small

  

<h2>4.3 - Creating a static website with S3 - PART1</h2><a name="4.3"></a>

---

- A static website address may use a domain from **Route 53** 

- Unchecking the **Block all public access** on bucket creation does not equal to allowing public access, only to allowing it being given through policies

- Static Website Hosting needs to be **enabled through bucket properties**

- Example URL automatically generated by AWS: http://top10-animals.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com 

  

<h2>4.4 - Creating a static website with S3 - PART2</h2><a name="4.4"></a>

---

- Resource policy example to grant public access to the site:

```json
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
      {
        "Sid":"PublicRead",
        "Effect":"Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
        "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::top10-animals/*"]
      }
    ]
}
```



<h2>4.5 - Object Versioning & MFA Delete</h2><a name="4.5"></a>

---

- Once enabled, versioning **CAN NOT** be disabled again, but **CAN** be suspended
- Without versioning, any modifications to an object results in it being replaced. With versioning, a new object is generated and the old one remains in place
- IDs for disabled versioning are **null**. By turning versioning on, S3 generates a **new ID for each modification** of an object, which is used for retrieval purposes 
- No ID specification in a request returns the **Current Version**, which is the last modification
- Deleting generates a new object known as a **Delete Marker** which hides all the previous version. By deleting the delete marker, all previous versions of an object are restored
- For a hard delete, the ID **needs to be specified**. If the current version is deleted, the next one in line becomes the new current version



<h2>4.6 - S3 Versioning</h2><a name="4.6"></a>

---

- Each version of a file contributes to total S3 storage, which may incur in higher bills

  

<h2>4.7 - S3 Performance Optimization</h2><a name="4.7"></a>

---

- Maximum single stream upload to S3 is 5GB, but even for this size it's **unreliable** (if there's an error, the whole transfer ends and leads to lost time plus lost transfer limit)

- Multipart upload can be broken into up to **10000 parts** with data size between 5MB and 5GB, which can each be **individually restarted** in case of failure

- Minimum multipart upload to S3 is **100MB**

- Default S3 file transfer through **the public internet may not have the most efficient route** and the user has no control over it

- S3 transfer acceleration first transfer files to an **AWS edge location** through public internet (which usually doesn't take as long, because it's a shorter distance), and then the data transits over **AWS Global Network** to the S3 bucket

- To enable S3 transfer acceleration, the bucket name **can't contain periods** and needs to be **DNS compatible**

<h2>4.9 - Key Management Service (KMS)</h2><a name="4.9"></a>

---

- Is a **regional and public service**

- Works with both **symmetric** and **asymmetric** keys

- Performs cryptographic operations **without the keys ever leaving the product**

- FIPS 140-2 compliance service (some features may have level 3 compliance)

  

### KMS Keys:

- A container used for encryption and decryption, which contains ID, date, policy, description and state

- Backed by a **physical key**, which is what actually does the operations

- The physical key may be imported or generated by KMS

- KMS keys can be used for **up to 4KB of data**

- Normally used for small data or to generate other keys

- **At absolutely no point during the operations the KMS key leaves the product**

  

**DEKs (Data Encryption Keys):**

- DEKs are generated by KMS keys with **GenerateDataKey** and can be used for data with over 4KB size

- Encryption/Decryption via DEKs is done **by the user or the service using KMS**

- DEKs are generated as a plain text format AND a ciphertext encrypted using the KMS key

- KMS doesn't track encryption done by DEKs, the same key may be used for any amount of encryptions

  

**DEK Flow:**

1. Data is encrypted using the **plain text key**

2. The **encrypted key** is stored alongside the encrypted data

3. The **encrypted key** is passed back to KMS asking for it to be decrypted by the **same KMS key used to generate it**

4. The **decrypted encryption key** given back by the KMS is then used to decrypt the data

5. The **decrypted encryption key** is then discarded
